# 📚 Learning with NotebookLM

Welcome! This repository is a curated collection of my learning workflows and insights generated using **NotebookLM**, Google's AI-powered research and writing assistant.

The goal of this project is to document how I leverage AI to synthesize complex information, connect disparate ideas, and accelerate my mastery of new subjects.

## 🚀 Project Overview

NotebookLM allows for "grounding" AI in specific, trusted sources. This repository serves as a permanent record of those explorations, featuring:
* **Curated Sources:** High-quality PDFs, web links, and transcripts used as knowledge bases.
* **Study Guides:** AI-generated summaries, FAQs, and concept maps.
* **Audio Insights:** Reflections and key takeaways from NotebookLM's "Deep Dive" audio overviews.
* **Prompt Engineering:** The specific queries used to extract the best insights from the sources.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The content is organized by domain:

* `📁 AI-&-Machine-Learning/`: Deep dives into LLMs, neural networks, and automation.
* `📁 Software-Engineering/`: Documentation notes, architecture patterns, and best practices.
* `📁 Product-Management/`: Insights on strategy, user research, and frameworks.
* `📁 Meta-Learning/`: Techniques on how to learn faster using AI tools.

## 🛠️ My Workflow

1.  **Curation:** Gathering reliable sources (whitepapers, official docs, or academic articles).
2.  **Grounding:** Uploading sources to NotebookLM to create a focused context.
3.  **Synthesis:** Using the AI to find gaps in my understanding or summarize complex themes.
4.  **Documentation:** Exporting the most valuable insights into Markdown files here.
